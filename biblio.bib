  abstract = {We present an object-oriented open-source framework for solving the dynamics of open quantum systems written in Python. Arbitrary Hamiltonians, including time-dependent systems, may be built up from operators and states defined by a quantum object class, and then passed on to a choice of master equation or Monte Carlo solvers. We give an overview of the basic structure for the framework before detailing the numerical simulation of open system dynamics. Several examples are given to illustrate the build up to a complete calculation. Finally, we measure the performance of our library against that of current implementations. The framework described here is particularly well suited to the fields of quantum optics, superconducting circuit devices, nanomechanics, and trapped ions, while also being ideal for use in classroom instruction.

We first present various definitions of spin squeezing parameters, explain their origin and properties for typical states, and then discuss spin-squeezed states produced with nonlinear twisting Hamiltonians. Afterward, we explain pairwise correlations and entanglement in spin-squeezed states, as well as the relations between spin squeezing and quantum Fisher information, where the latter plays a central role in quantum metrology. We also review the applications of spin squeezing for detecting quantum chaos and quantum phase transitions, as well as the influence of decoherence on spin squeezing. Finally, we review several experimental realizations of spin squeezing, as well as their corresponding theoretical backgrounds, including: producing spin-squeezed states via particle collisions in Bose–Einstein condensates, transferring photon squeezing to atomic ensembles, and generating spin squeezing via quantum non-demolition measurements.}

In this paper we give a more detailed exposition of the scheme, expanding on several aspects that were not discussed in full previously. The basic concept of the scheme is that spin coherent states are used instead of qubits to encode qubit information, and manipulated using collective spin operators. The scheme goes beyond the continuous variable regime such that the full space of the Bloch sphere is used. We construct a general framework for quantum algorithms to be executed using multiple spin coherent states, which are individually controlled. We illustrate the scheme by applications to quantum information protocols, and discuss possible experimental implementations. Decoherence effects are analyzed under both general conditions and for the experimental implementation proposed.}

Doing so, however, may destroy or compromise these delicate quantum states.

They then map the quantum state of one of the diamond defects onto the other. The work presents a key building block for the successful development of larger quantum networks. Science, this issue p. 532; see also p. 510 A quantum state can now be teleported unconditionally between diamond defects 3 meters apart. [Also see Perspective by Atatüre and Morton] Realizing robust quantum information transfer between long-lived qubit registers is a key challenge for quantum information science and technology. Here we demonstrate unconditional teleportation of arbitrary quantum states between diamond spin qubits separated by 3 meters. We prepare the teleporter through photon-mediated heralded entanglement between two distant electron spins and subsequently encode the source qubit in a single nuclear spin. By realizing a fully deterministic Bell-state measurement combined with real-time feed-forward, quantum teleportation is achieved upon each attempt with an average state fidelity exceeding the classical limit. These results establish diamond spin qubits as a prime candidate for the realization of quantum networks for quantum communication and network-based quantum computing.},

In interferometric sensors, they allow us to overcome the ‘classical’ projection noise limit stemming from the independent nature of the individual photons or atoms within the interferometer. Motivated by the potential impact on metrology as well as by fundamental questions in the context of entanglement, a lot of theoretical and experimental effort has been made to study squeezed states. The first squeezed states useful for quantum-enhanced metrology have been proposed and generated in quantum optics, where the squeezed variables are the coherences of the light field. In this tutorial, we focus on spin squeezing in atomic systems. We give an introduction to its concepts and discuss its generation in Bose–Einstein condensates. We discuss in detail the experimental requirements necessary for the generation and direct detection of coherent spin squeezing. Two exemplary experiments demonstrating adiabatically prepared spin squeezing based on motional degrees of freedom and diabatically realized spin squeezing based on internal hyperfine degrees of freedom are discussed.}

These devices have, however, required low-noise detection capabilities that have hampered their development. Hosten et al. describe a method that manipulates a coherent cloud of cold rubidium atoms in a way that relaxes the ultrasensitive detection requirements. The general method may be applied to other coherent quantum systems. Science, this issue p. 1552 Manipulation of cold atoms is used for quantum-enhanced precision measurements. Quantum metrology exploits entangled states of particles to improve sensing precision beyond the limit achievable with uncorrelated particles. All previous methods required detection noise levels below this standard quantum limit to realize the benefits of the intrinsic sensitivity provided by these states. We experimentally demonstrate a widely applicable method for entanglement-enhanced measurements without low-noise detection. The method involves an intermediate quantum phase magnification step that eases implementation complexity. We used it to perform squeezed-state metrology 8 decibels below the standard quantum limit with a detection system that has a noise floor 10 decibels above the standard quantum limit.},

Our method is advantageous over the full determination of the density matrix in that it is insensitive to experimental fluctuations in j, and allows for a natural elimination of high-frequency noise in the Wigner function by taking into account the experimental uncertainties in the determination of j, its projection m and the quantization axis orientation. No data binning and no arbitrary smoothing parameters are necessary in this reconstruction. Using recently published data (Riedel et al 2010 Nature 464 1170), we reconstruct the Wigner function of a spin-squeezed state of a Bose–Einstein condensate of about 1250 atoms, demonstrating that measurements along quantization axes lying in a single plane are sufficient for performing this tomographic reconstruction. Our method does not guarantee positivity of the reconstructed density matrix in the presence of experimental noise, which is a general limitation of backprojection algorithms.}

	abstract = {We study the robustness of quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement induced entanglement between Bose–Einstein condensates (BECs). We consider an experimental scheme where two BECs are placed in the paths of a Mach–Zehnder interferometer, and a QND interaction creates entanglement between coherent light and the atoms. We analyze the two dominant channels of decoherence, atomic dephasing and photon loss on the entangled states produced by this scheme. We calculate the effect of dephasing on the variance and expectation values of the spin operators, entanglement and correlation criteria. Our analysis does not use the Holstein–Primakoff approximation, and is capable of modelling long light–atom interaction times, producing non-Gaussian states beyond the two-mode squeezed states. In the presence of dephasing, the entangled states are robust in the macroscopic limit as long as the dimensionless interaction time is less than , where N is the number of atoms in the BEC. For photon loss, the entangled states generated by long interaction times show a remarkable robustness that makes the scheme promising for various quantum information applications.}

The corresponding Kraus operators from the point of view of quantum channel are derived, whose normalization conditions are proved. Miscellaneous characters possessed by different quantum channels, such as decoherence, phase diffusion, damping, and amplification, can be shown explicitly in the entangled state representation of the density operators. Squeezing transformation is applied to the density operator for decoherence to generate a master equation for describing the phase sensitive process. Partial trace method for deriving new density operators is also introduced. Throughout our discussion, the technique of integration within an ordered product (IWOP) of operators is fully used.},

abstract = {A state of a quantum-mechanical system is completely described by a density matrix or a phase-space distribution such as the Wigner function. The complete family of squeezed states of light (states that have less uncertainty in one observable than does the vacuum state) have been generated using an optical parametric amplifier, and their density matrices and Wigner functions have been reconstructed from measurements of the quantum statistics of their electric fields. A central theme in many fields of quantum physics is the development and application of theoretical and experimental tools for obtaining information about the states of quantum fields of matter and radiation. Although the state of an individual particle or system is unobservable, it is possible to determine the state of an ensemble of identically prepared systems by performing a large number of measurements 1 • Notable experimental succcess has recently been achieved in generating and determining states of various quantum-mechanical systems, employing newly developed methods of quantum state reconstruction (QSR) 2-9 • A single mode of light 10-1 4, vibrational modes of a diatomic molecule 15 and of an ion in a Paul trap 16 , and the motional state of freely propagating atoms 17 have been characterized completely by determining their density matrix or, equivalently, their Wigner functions, a quantum-mechanical analogue of the classical phase-space distribution 1 8 • A single spatial monochromatic mode of light represents a harmonic oscillator system for which non-classical states can be generated very efficiently using the interaction of laser light with nonlinear optical media. Squeezed states 19 , first generated about ten years ago 20 • 21 , have a reduced uncertainty in a specific quadrature (for example the amplitude quadrature) compared to that of the vacuum state. They have typically been characterized by measuring the variances of the electric field with a homodyne detector. A complete investigation of their quantum features, in particular their photon statistics (which at present cannot be measured directly owing to technical limitations of available photon counters) has only become possible through the recent development of theoretical tools for QSR. First experimental investigations analysed coherent and squeezed vacuum states 10 • 11 • 13 • 14 • Here we present a study of all types of squeezed states of light; squeezed vacuum, amplitude-squeezed states, phase-squeezed states and states squeezed in an arbitrary quadrature. For each of these states we construct 'portraits' in terms of both the Wigner functions (which are two-dimensional maps in appropriate phase-space coordinates) and the density matrices. These portraits contain all that one can know about the quantum-mechanical properties of the squeezed optical states. Optical homodyne tomography How is the quantum state of an optical wave determined? The measurements to be performed on the state are measurements of the electric field operator E(0) rx X 8 = X cos 0 + Y sin 0 at all phase angles 0. Here X =(a+ at)/V2,, Y = (a-a')!Vli are the non-commuting quadrature operators of the electric field, with a and at being the annihilation and creation operators. X and Y are analogous to position and momentum operators of a particle in a harmonic potential. To access experimentally the electric field, which oscillates with a frequency of w/21r of hundreds of THz, a balanced homodyne detector 22 is employed (see Fig. 1). In this NATURE I VOL 387129 MAY 1997 detector, the signal wave is spatially overlapped at a beamsplitter with a local-oscillator wave of the same frequency. The two fields emerging from the beamsplitter are proportional to the sum and the difference of the signal and local-oscillator fields. By detecting the difference of their fluxes, the natural oscillation of the signal state under investigation is converted to a low-frequency electrical signal i{\_}, which measures Xe, where 0 is the relative phase between signal and local oscillator. A large number of measurements of the observable Xe yields the probability distribution Pe(Xe) of its eigenvalues Xe-This procedure is repeated for a set of different phase angles 0 E [O, 1r]. The relation between the measured distributions and the density operator p is P 8 (x8) = (x I if(0)pU(0) Ix), where U(0) = exp(-i0at a) performs a rotation in phase space. As the optical state evolves freely with w, U is equivalent to the time evolution operator with 0 = wt+ constant, and the 0-dependence of Pe is equivalent to the time dependence of the position probability density of the state (that is, of 1,1,(x, t)l 2 , if p = 1,1,)(,l,},

The error ellipsoids associated with the minimum-uncertainty states for this system are presented. The implications of these results for the squeezing of the field vectors of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by spins and quasi-two-level atomic systems (in states which have been prepared by coherent transient driving fields) are pointed out. {\textcopyright} 1985 American Institute of Physics.},

The degree of squeezing is derived for the rubidium system in the presence of scattering causing decoherence and loss. We describe how the system can decohere and lose atoms, and predict as much as 75% spin squeezing for atomic densities typical of optical dipole traps.}

The quantum measurement operator takes the form of a positive operator valued measure (POVM) and is valid for arbitrary interaction times, initial coherent state amplitudes, and final photon measurement outcomes. We analyze the dependence on various parameters and show that the effect of the QND measurement for short interaction times is to apply a Gaussian modulation of the initial state wavefunction. We derive approximate expressions for the POVM in various limits, such as the short interaction time regime and projective measurement limit. Several examples are shown, which show how spin squeezing and Schrodinger cat states can be generated using the measurement.}",

abstract = {Atom-based measurements of length, time, gravity, inertial forces and electromagnetic fields are receiving increasing attention. Atoms possess properties that suggest clear advantages as self calibrating platforms for measurements of these quantities. In this review, we describe work on a new method for measuring radio frequency (RF) electric fields based on quantum interference using either Cs or Rb atoms contained in a dielectric vapor cell. Using a bright resonance prepared within an electromagnetically induced transparency window it is possible to achieve high sensitivities, &lt;1 μV cm−1 Hz−1/2, and detect small RF electric fields  μV cm−1 with a modest setup. Some of the limitations of the sensitivity are addressed in the review. The method can be used to image RF electric fields and can be adapted to measure the vector electric field amplitude. Extensions of Rydberg atom-based electrometry for frequencies up to the terahertz regime are described.}

Squeezed states could be employed in the next generation of more sensitive advanced detectors currently under construction, such as Advanced LIGO, to further push the limits of the observable gravitational wave Universe. To maximize the benefit from squeezing, environmentally induced disturbances such as back scattering and angular jitter need to be mitigated. We discuss the limitations of current squeezed vacuum sources in relation to the requirements imposed by future gravitational wave detectors, and show a design for squeezed light injection which overcomes these limitations.},

    abstract = "{We study the effects of optical and atomic decoherence in entangled atomic ensembles produced via quantum nondemolition (QND) measurements. We examine potentially experimentally detrimental effects, such as optical phase diffusion, photon loss and gain, and atomic dephasing. For the optical decoherence channels, we use the technique of integration within ordered operators to obtain the associated Kraus operators. We analyze the effect of different decoherence channels on various quantities, such as the variances of the spin operators, entanglement and correlation criteria, logarithmic negativity, and the Bell–CHSH inequality. We generally find a smooth decay of correlations and entanglement in the presence of decoherence. In the short interaction time range, we find that various quantities show signals consistent with, and showing that entanglement exists under all three types of decoherence. Our results show that QND measurements are one of the most promising methods for entanglement generation between two Bose–Einstein condensates.}"}
